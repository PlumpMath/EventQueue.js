EventQueue.js - A small Javascript action queuing system.

EventQueue.js allows you to queue name-spaced actions and attach
a countdown value. When the countdown value reaches zero
the code attached to the action will be executed unless 
another action has occurred within the same name space.

Optionally you can supply the tick value which represents the
granularity of the clock, as well as a delimiter for controlling more
complex name spaces.

Example Usage:

var queue = new EventQueue();

/*
 * Add an action that will execute after 5 seconds.
 */	
queue.enqueue({
    name: 'Foo:bar', //method bar for module Foo
    timeout: 5,     // Wait 5s before executing
    repeat: true,    // repeat indefinitely
    immediate: true, // start immediately
    action: function(){
	console.log('Hello, from the future!');
    }		    
});

//remove all methods related to Foo
queue.dequeue({name: 'Foo'}); 

/*
 * Annoyingly, fire an alert every 10 seconds
 */
queue.enqueue({
    name: 'Annoying',
    timeout: 10,
    repeat: true,
    immediate: true, // start immediately
    action: function(){
	alert('ack, dequeue me');
    }
});

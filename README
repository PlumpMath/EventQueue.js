Q.js - An small Javascript action queuing system.

Q.js allows you to queue name-spaced actions and attach
a countdown value. When the countdown value reaches zero
the code attached to the action will be executed unless 
another action has occurred within the same name space.

Optionally you can supply the tick value which represents the
granularity of the clock, as well as a delimiter for controlling more
complex name spaces.

Example Usage:

var queue = new Q();

/*
 * Add an action that will execute after 30 seconds.
 */	
queue.enqueue({
    name: 'Foo:bar', //method bar for module Foo
    timeout: 30,     // Wait 30s before executing
    action: function(){
	console.log('Hello, from the future!');
    }		    
});

//remove all methods related to Foo
queue.dequeue({name: 'Foo'}); 

/*
 * Annoyingly, fire an alert every minute
 */
queue.enqueue({
    name: 'Annoying',
    timeout: 60,
    repeat: true,
    action: function(){
	alert('ack, dequeue me');
    }
});

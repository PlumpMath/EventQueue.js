EventQueue.js - A small Javascript action queuing system.

EventQueue.js allows you to queue name-spaced actions and attach
a countdown value. When the countdown value reaches zero
the code attached to the action will be executed unless 
another action has occurred within the same name space.

Optionally you can supply the tick value which represents the
granularity of the clock, as well as a delimiter for controlling more
complex name spaces.

Example Usage:

var queue = new EventQueue();

/*
 * Add an action that will execute every 5 seconds.
 */	
queue.enqueue({
    name: 'Foo:bar', //method bar for module Foo
    timeout: 5,     // Wait 5s before executing
    repeat: true,    // repeat indefinitely
    immediate: true, // start immediately
    action: function(){
	console.log('Hello, from the future!');
    }		    
});

//remove all methods related to Foo
queue.dequeue({name: 'Foo'}); 

/*
 * Annoyingly, fire an alert every 10 seconds
 */
queue.enqueue({
    name: 'Annoying',
    timeout: 10,
    repeat: true,
    immediate: true, // start immediately
    action: function(){
	alert('ack, dequeue me');
    }
});

// This is an, admittedly, contrived example on how the optional 
// context argument is useful.


var Context = function(){
    var now = (new Date()).getTime();

    var print = function(){
	console.log("I started at " + now + " it is now " + (new Date()).getTime());
    }

    this.printMessage = print;

    this.doContextTest = function(){
	queue.enqueue({
	    name: 'Context',
	    timeout: 1,
	    repeat: true,
	    action: function(){
		this.printMessage();
	    }
	}, this);
    }
}

var ctx = new Context();

...

<input type="button" value="Run context test" onclick="return ctx.doContextTest();" />
